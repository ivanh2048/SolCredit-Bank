Bank Project
This project is a banking simulation designed for educational purposes. The main goal is to create a web application to manage banking functions such as account registration, authorization, transaction management, PIN verification and card blocking.

PIN Code Management: During registration, a PIN code is generated for login.
Card Block: Implemented a feature that blocks cards to prevent unwanted transactions.
Transaction Management: Check account status before making transactions.
Status
The project is at the stage of transition from frontend to backend, with the main goal of ensuring the reliability and security of the banking system.
